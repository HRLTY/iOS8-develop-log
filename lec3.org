* lecture 3 note
** there are two differences between *struct* and *class* in Swift
  one, struct don't have inheritance.
  two, struct are passed by value, class are passed by reference.
** unless you pass a class argument, arguments are passed by value
   struct can have function, property.
   Array and dictionary are structs.
** there is a implicit *let* in front of arguments copied
   but you can make your owe "var".
   However, Swift is super smart to not extra copy actually unless you
   actually change it.
